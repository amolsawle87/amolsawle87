### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With a Bachelorâ€™s degree from IIT Madras and a deep knowledge of Python, JavaScript, Flask, AWS, and various tools like TensorFlow and Docker to create scalable, efficient systems, Iâ€™ve successfully improved performance, enhanced user experiences, and optimized processes for companies like ICICI Bank and Instaminutes. 

As a Software Engineer with a robust background in Mobile App Development Technology, Machine Learning, and Backend Development, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of leading cross-functional teams and developing high-impact solutions. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. My projects range from implementing backend solutions for startups to deploying machine learning models for real-time data processing and facial emotion detection.

Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects in software engineering or data science. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for someone passionate about solving complex problems, bringing creativity, technical expertise, and a results-oriented approach to the table.
